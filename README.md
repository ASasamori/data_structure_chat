this is a next app to help make course scheduling easier at uc berkeley

built this in three days solo, if this is interesting to anyone email me (masonarditi@berkeley.edu) and we can chat or maybe make it for your school.

the website is live at www.calgpt.xyz

it is pretty glitchy right now with vague prompts, try to be specific when you ask questions. refer to the sample questions for ideas.
